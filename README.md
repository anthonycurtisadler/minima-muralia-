# minima-muralia-
A FUN AND MEDITATIVE PROGRAM WRITTEN IN PYTHON FOR DRAWING MINIMALIST SCREEN ART USING UNICODE BOX CHARACTERS 


You need to create a folder "textfiles" if you wish to save a screen shot. (Does not yet have the capacity to load projects)

<minimilia muralia.py> is the main program. Click on this, with python installed, to run. 
Because it relies on curses, it will not run properly from idle.

TYPE SHIFT F12 for the help menu

CURSES must be installed as an external dependency.


While "minima muralia" is restrictive in its aesthetic possibilities, it is rich in features, being based on "objects" discreet objects, which can be copied, cut and pasted. It is even possible to take an existing object and automatically divide it into discreet component objects. 

It can also implement a version of Conway's Game of Life, modified to allow for various degrees of randomness.
